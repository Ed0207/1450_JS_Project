This file is the finished product, but can be updated if requried

The main logic of the game:

	
	Create two objects : the background object and the block object.

	Two objects are treated differently for the convenience to calculate different situation.

	Background and blocks object will be refresh and printed out every 0.05 second to display block movement

	Every 1 second the block will calculate if it will fall down or stack on the other block/ reach the bottom

	If stack up on the other block or reach bottom, the function will update the background with the position of the current block

	The function will generate a new block for the next round.

	The game will then proceed to check if any row is completed or the game will be over.

	The game will only be over if where the new block generated overlap with the background.


Known issue so far:

	When object reaches the bottom and player keep pressing "s" or "down" key, the error message will pop up in console due to type error 
	(does not affect calculation or any functionality)

	When player click start game multiple times, the game will speed up, possibly due to multiple event loops running at the same time.

	After game over, if player press start game button again, the game will start running with the current state again.

	The speed up function is not yet programmed in the game.
